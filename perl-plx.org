#+title: Segregate Perl Projects with App::plx
#+author: Nicholas Hubbard

[[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]] (plx) is a tool for configuring per-project Perl development
environments.

Plx is not difficult to use and has very clear documentation. In this post
I will give a brief overview of some of the problems that it solves and how to
get started using it.

This is not a complete overview on everything that plx can do.

* Why Plx?

Imagine that you have a project that depends on a Perl version greater than that
of your systems built-in Perl. You will need to install the correct version of
Perl and figure out how to get your project to use this Perl instead of the
system Perl.

Next imagine a scenario where you are working on two different Perl projects
that depend on a different version of the same CPAN module. You will need to
figure out how to install both versions into different locations, and then you
will need to figure out how to locate the correct version from the two different
projects.

These are two important problems that plx solves.

* Installation

Before you can use plx you must install plx.

If you already have a CPAN installer, such as [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus][cpanminus]], then you should
probably just use that to install plx.

Plx can also be bootstrapped into a self contained script like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ mkdir "$HOME/bin"
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shadowcat-mst/plx/master/bin/plx-packed -O "$HOME/bin/plx"
$ chmod +x "$HOME/bin/plx"
#+END_SRC

You can install plx into any directory, I just chose "$HOME/bin" for simplicity.
Just make sure you pick a directory that is in your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][PATH]].

* Initialization

If you want to use plx for your Perl project, you must first initialize the
project to use plx. To do this we must =cd= into the root directory of the
project and then execute plx with the =--init= flag.

The =--init= flag behaves differently depending on its argument.

When =--init= is called with a file path, it assumes it is the path is to a Perl
interpreter and sets up plx to use it.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ plx --init /path/to/some/perl
#+END_SRC

When called with =perl= as the argument it sets up plx to use the first Perl
in your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][PATH]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ plx --init perl
#+END_SRC

The final and most exciting way to call =--init= is with a Perl version
number. When called with a version number, plx will look for a Perl of the given
version first in your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][PATH]] and otherwise via [[https://perlbrew.pl/][Perlbrew]].

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ plx --init 5.36.0
#+END_SRC

After initializing plx you can execute your project code with a command like
=plx /path/to/project/script.pl=, and plx will execute the script with the Perl
interpreter you specified with the =plx --init= command.

This is how plx solves the problem of needing to use a different Perl than your
systems built-in Perl.

* Installing CPAN Modules

My favorite feature of plx is that it allows you to install modules off of CPAN
into a [[https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib][local::lib]] using [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus][cpanminus]]. This allows you to segragate your CPAN
modules dependencies on a per-project basis.

To do this we must =cd= into the root directory of our project and run the
following command.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ plx --cpanm -Llocal Some::Module
#+END_SRC

This will install =Some::Module= into a project-local library located in a
directory named =local/lib= at the root of the project.

This solves the problem of two projects requiring different versions of the same
CPAN module. If both projects use plx they can simply install their desired
version into a [[https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib][local::lib]].

* Userstrap

What if you want to use your own Perl interpreter and a [[https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib][local::lib]] when you are
working outside of a dedicated plx project?

Plx has a =--userstrap= flag that will set this up for you automatically.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ plx --userstrap /path/to/some/perl
#+END_SRC

Calling =--userstrap= essentially sets up your =$HOME= to be a plx project and
sets up a [[https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib][local::lib]] in =$HOME/perl5=, installs [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::plx][App::plx]] and [[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus][App::cpanminus]] into
the local::lib, and adds a line to your =$HOME/.bashrc= that sets up plx for
your Bash shell.

Now when you run plx from outside a dedicated plx project it will use =$HOME= as
a sort of default plx project. You can use =--userstrap= to prevent needing to
use your system Perl, and can instead always use plx.

Note that =--userstrap= requires that you use a Bash shell.

* Plx is For Everybody

Plx is designed to not only provide a nice experience for Perl developers but
also to be usable by a sysadmin that isn't a Perl expert. Therefore plx is
configured through simple text files that can be manipulated by hand, and allows
multiple commands to be run in a single plx invocation via the =--multi= flag,
which makes scripting plx cleaner.

* Synopsis

Plx is a tool for creating per-project virtual Perl environments. Plx lets us
avoid a lot of headaches that come with developing multiple Perl projects on the
same system.

A lot of what Plx does can be done by combining features of other CPAN modules,
but plx brings together these functionalities in a way that is easy to use and
understand.

This blog post is only a brief introduction to plx. Please go on to read the
manual for more a more detailed overview of its features.

* Bonus Tip for Emacs Users

If you lint your Perl code with the Perl interpreter using Flycheck, you will
need to determine if the buffer is part of a plx project so it runs the Perl
interpreter through Plx.

Use the following code to do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
(require 'flycheck)
(require 'projectile)

(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
(add-hook 'cperl-mode-hook 'my/cperl-select-correct-flycheck-checker)

(flycheck-define-checker my/perl-plx
  :command ("plx" "-w" "-c"
            (option-list "-I" flycheck-perl-include-path)
            (option-list "-M" flycheck-perl-module-list concat))
  :standard-input t
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start (minimal-match (message))
          " at - line " line
          (or "." (and ", " (zero-or-more not-newline))) line-end))
  :modes (perl-mode cperl-mode))

(defun my/cperl-select-correct-flycheck-checker ()
  "If the current buffer is part of a plx project then use the `my/perl-plx'
checker, otherwise use the `perl' checker."
  (let ((proj-root (projectile-project-root)))
    (if (and proj-root (file-directory-p (concat proj-root ".plx")))
        (flycheck-select-checker 'my/perl-plx)
      (flycheck-select-checker 'perl))))
#+END_SRC
